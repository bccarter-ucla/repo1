<h1> A Virtual Safe Space for the Homesick</h1>
<h4> I created this space as a way to process my longing to be home, in Fairfield and Los Angeles. 
    I long to be home, even though being home can be confusing. I wish anywhere could feel like home,
    but that's probably not the point. Being home makes me feel connected to places, people, animals,
    and organisms, like reeds and birds. Home is made up of multiple components that wind together like
    a hammock, to cradle and support you.

    I hope that this space can provide a loving respite for people experiencing homesickness. </h4>
